/* The shred tile partitions a block into batches of microblocks,
   and it partitions each batch into fixed-size FEC sets, with 32
   data shreds and 32 parity shreds each.  For a given batch, only
   an integer number of microblocks are allowed, which means that
   no microblock can cross the batch boundary, and that the payload
   for the last FEC set needs to be padded with 0s.  The padding
   completes the payload of the last FEC set in the batch, not the
   batch itself.  Therefore, no FEC set can contain only 0s, and a
   a batch may contain less FEC sets than the allocated quantity.
   The number of FEC sets per batch is arbitrary.  The larger the
   value, the less padding overhead in every batch.  However, the
   larger the value, the longer it takes before the tile can start
   generating and sending FEC sets.  Assuming n batches in a given
   block, the (upper-limit) quantity of FEC sets is determined by
   FD_SHRED_BATCH_FEC_SETS_WMARK for batch ids [0, n-2], and by
   FD_SHRED_BATCH_FEC_SETS_MAX for batch id n-1.  This is needed
   because when the microblock completing the block is received,
   it must be included in the current batch irrespective of how
   full the latter might be.  The diagrams below (not at scale)
   show 2 FEC sets before the watermark (W), which indicates where
   to close the current batch, as well as 2 extra FEC sets that
   are available for the last batch in the block.

     Normal: (to be deprecated)
       +------------+------------+~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~+
       |   FEC_set  |   FEC_set (W)    extra |      extra |
       +------------+------------+~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~+

     Chained: (batch ids [0, n-2])
       +-----------+-----------+~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~+
       |   FEC_set |  FEC_set (W)   extra |     extra |
       +-----------+-----------+~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~+

     Resigned: (last batch in block)
       +----------+----------+~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~+
       |  FEC_set | FEC_set (W)   extra |    extra |
       +----------+----------+~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~+

   Batch ids [0, n-2] are chained, whereas batch id n-1 (the
   last one in the block) is (chained+)resigned, with a smaller
   payload capacity.  The transition between the two implies a
   watermark regression, requiring FD_SHRED_BATCH_FEC_SETS_EXTRA
   to be able to support (at least) FD_POH_SHRED_MTU bytes plus
   the watermark regression.  This payload reduction does not
   affect normal FEC sets, which are scheduled to be deprecated
   at some point (TODO). */
